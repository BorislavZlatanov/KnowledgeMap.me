# knowledgemap.me
This Github repository is used as the data repository for https://www.knowledgemap.me/. 

You can find the file [Resources.csv](https://github.com/BorislavZlatanov/knowledgemap.me/blob/master/Resources.csv) here. It contains the public Resource data entered in https://www.knowledgemap.me/.

The file escapes special characters in the CSV format such as quotes ("), so your import tool will also need to follow the same standard.
