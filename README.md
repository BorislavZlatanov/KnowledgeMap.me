# KnowledgeMap.me - Data repository
This is the open data repository for https://www.knowledgemap.me/. 

The data is stored in the file [Resources.csv](https://github.com/BorislavZlatanov/knowledgemap.me/blob/master/Resources.csv) in CSV (comma-separated values) format. The file contains all public Resource data entered in https://www.knowledgemap.me/.

The file escapes special characters in the CSV format such as quotes ("), so your import tool will also need to follow the same standard.
