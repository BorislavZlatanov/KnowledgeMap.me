36,"Alan Alda's Flame Challenge presents: ""What Is Color?""","What is color? It seems like a simple question at first, but when you think about it, the reality of what we're seeing is a pretty complex situation. Our human eyes sift through a small piece of the vast electromagnetic spectrum and translate it into every color of the rainbow. But there are other animals that see these same wavelengths in different ways, or even see colors beyond what we can perceive! And not all color is dependent on wavelengths of light: the brains of certain people, called synesthetes, work in ways that let them see colors tied to music, words, or other stimuli. Watch as host Alan Alda takes you on a surreal, scientific tour of the spectrum with the help of vision researcher Jay Neitz, along with neuroscientists David Eagleman, Kaitlyn Hova, and Bevil Conway.",colors|science,"World Science Festival (http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/)",Lecture,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAFWJGK0G_A,2014-07-08,5
98,"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware","Software development happens in your head. Not in an editor, <span class=""caps"">IDE</span>, or design tool. You’re well educated on how to work with software and hardware, but what about <em>wetware</em>—our own brains? Learning new skills and new technology is critical to your career, and it’s all in your head.

In this book by Andy Hunt, you’ll learn how our brains are wired, and how to take advantage of your brain’s architecture. You’ll learn new tricks and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn.

102,"The Neuroscience of Learning and Memory","Jeanette Norden, Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology, Emerita, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, explores how the brain learns and remembers. This video focuses on a discussion of how the brain is organized in general.

These lectures will provide the foundation
information necessary to the understanding
of the lectures which will follow. A special
emphasis will be given to systems in the brain
that underlie learning and memory, attention
and awareness. These introductory lectures
will be followed by a lecture on how different
areas of the brain encode different, specific
types of information—from the phone number
we need only remember for a few minutes or
less to the childhood memories we retain for
a lifetime. We will also address the ""mistakes
of memory"" which give insight as to how the
brain actually encodes our life experiences.
The last group of lectures in this series will
focus on the many clinical conditions that can
affect different types of learning and memory.
Lastly, we will focus our discussion on the
accumulating evidence that aging need not be
associated with significant memory loss. We
will discuss advancements in neuroscience that
indicate ways to keep your brain healthy as
you age.

106,"The Ultimate List of Free Stock Photography Sites","Strong design is based on strong imagery. Unfortunately, strong imagery requires a good photographer and that costs money. In the past we were limited to stock photography sites that charge ten quid an image or absolutely terrible free stock photography that cost you conversions.

<i>Thankfully, things are changing.</i>

There’s now hundreds of sites offering free or freemium stock photography services. But with the good comes the bad and that means much of our time is spent wading through the rubbish. What we needed was a list of the best free stock photography sites out there.
<h3>So that’s what we created.</h3>
Our article pulls together the best of the <strong>best free stock photography sites</strong> so you don’t have to, freeing up your time to do the important things like being creative.",free|photographies,"Digital Impact (https://www.digitalimpact.co.uk/)",Article,https://www.digitalimpact.co.uk/ultimate-list-of-free-stock-photos/,2016-01-11,4.5

112,"Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems","The rules of battle for tracking down -- and eliminating -- hardware and software bugs. When the pressure is on to root out an elusive software or hardware glitch, what's needed is a cool head courtesy of a set of rules guaranteed to work on any system, in any circumstance. Written in a frank but engaging style, <i>Debugging</i> provides simple, foolproof principles guaranteed to help find any bug quickly. This book makes those shelves of application-specific debugging books (on C++, Perl, Java, etc.) obsolete. It changes the way readers think about debugging, making those pesky problems suddenly much easier to find and fix. Illustrating the rules with real-life bug-detection war stories, the book shows readers how to: * Understand the system: how perceiving the """"roadmap"""" can hasten your journey * Quit thinking and look: when hands-on investigation can't be avoided * Isolate critical factors: why changing one element at a time can be an essential tool * Keep an audit trail: how keeping a record of the debugging process can win the day""",debugging|effectiveness|programming,"David Agans (http://debuggingrules.com/)",Book,https://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Indispensable-Software-Hardware-Problems/dp/0814474578,2006-11-05,5
